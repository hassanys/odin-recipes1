    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Combine the classic flavours of chicken and chorizo with kale and rice for a substantial yet speedy dinner, taking less than 20 minutes to make</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250g chicken breast, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 leek, halved lengthways and finely sliced</li>
        <li>80g kale, any tough stalks removed, leaves roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 x 250g pouches microwave wholegrain rice</li>
        <li>1 tbsp low salt soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a frying pan over a high heat and fry the chicken for 3 mins. Stir in the chorizo and cook for 2 mins more until the chicken is light golden and the chorizo has released its fat. Scoop the chicken and chorizo into a bowl using a slotted spoon, leaving as much oil in the pan as you can. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Tip the leek and red pepper into the pan and cook for 2 mins, stirring frequently until slightly softened. Add the kale and fry for 1 min more until the leaves have just started to wilt at the edges.</li>
        <li>Drizzle in the soy sauce and vinegar and scatter in the rice, breaking up any large chunks with a wooden spoon. Stir the chicken and chorizo back into the pan and toss everything together to combine. Cook for 3 mins until the rice is heated through, then serve.</li>        
    </ol>
